    "## WIMPs and Axions\n",
    "\n",
    "In these lectures we will discuss detector technologies used in direct searches for two varieties of dark matter candidates, WIMPs and axions. We will introduce WIMPs and axions today. We will cover WIMPs in the subseqent $3\\frac{1}{2}$ lectures and axions in the subsequent $3\\frac{1}{2}$. First, let us summarise the origins and basic properties of these two classes of candidates.\n",

    "### WIMPs\n",
    "\n",
    "WIMPs arise in extensions to the standard model of particle physics connected to the electroweak sector. Between the mid 1970s and the mid 1980s, ideas of how to unify the weak nuclear forces with electromagnetism were developed by, amongst others, Sheldon Glashow, Steve Weinberg and Abdus Salam. These ideas led to the prediction of heavy vector gauge bosons, $W^\\pm$ and $Z^0$, which together with the photon $\\gamma$ are the carriers of the unified electroweak force. This unification comes into effect at energies around and above the rest energies of the $W$ and $Z$ bosons. It is possible from quite easy back of the envelope calculations to estimate the masses of the heavy bosons, at around $\\rm 100\\,GeV$, and in the mid 1980s they were discovered at the UA1 and UA2 detectors on the super proton synchrotron (SPS) accelerator at CERN. Much later, in 2015, the Higgs boson, which plays a very significant role in electroweak unification, was also discovered, this time at the large hadron collider (LHC), at a mass of $\\rm 125\\,GeV$. This completed the confirmation of electroweak unification, a major achievement of high energy particle physics. \n",
    "\n",
    "The excitement around the discovery of such a rich seam of new physics led theorists and phenomenologists to attack remaining problems with the standard model by proposing further new physics at around the electroweak energy scale of $\\rm 100\\,GeV$. For example, in the standard model, the so-called Higgs self energy, the energy of the interactions of a Higgs boson with itself, is calculated to be infinite. These kinds of divergences and infinities plague the quantum field theories used to model the physics of elementary particles and fields. This particular divergence goes away when the Higgs self-energy is calculated in supersymmetric extensions to the standard model, where each of the discovered fermions, particles with half-integer spin quantum number, has a partner boson, and vice versa. \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of supersymmetry leads to the hypothesis of many new particles whose masses are naturally high, otherwise they would have been seen in accelerators already. The dark matter problem, which by the 1970s was already being discussed, could be solved if the lightest of these supersymmetric particles was stable for some reason, perhaps because of a new discrete conserved symmetry known as R-parity. The lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) became a dark matter candidate. In one idea, this lightest supersymmetric particle is called the neutralino. The broad idea, that the lightest supersymmetric particle is stable and solves the dark matter problem has become very popular. This is in part because of the naturalness argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Naturalness argument\n",
    "\n",
    "The naturalness argument has to do with the modelling that has been done to predict the present-day abundance of hypothetical WIMP dark matter. WIMPs are thought to be produced in the early Universe in a freeze-out mechanism, in which at some energy scale the WIMPs decouple due to the expansion of the Universe from the populations of other particles. If the energy scale where this decoupling occurs, remembering that lower energies correspond to later times, is about $\\rm 100\\,GeV$, it turns out that the predicted present-day abundance of WIMPs is about right to solve the dark matter problem. This observation, sometimes called the WIMP miracle, drives many investigators to focus on WIMPs as the likely solution to the dark matter problem. However, searches for supersymmetry at the large hadron collider have failed to discover any new electroweak scale physics so far. As these experiments continue to run, the mass of supersymmetric WIMPs is pushed higher and higher, which is eroding the naturalness argument, since heavier WIMPs decouple later and form less of the dark matter. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Non-superymmetric WIMPs\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not to say that WIMPs have to be supersymmetric. There are other theoretical ideas that lead to the possibility of a WIMP, and a lot of theoretical and phenomenological work has been done to work out these other possibilities too. There is no space to discuss all these ideas here. However, again, new electroweak physics of any sort is being probed by the large hadron collider, so we may learn in the future exactly which, if any, of these ideas, is correct. We may then also learn the masses of the particles that are discovered, which would in turn make the searches for WIMP dark matter far more focussed. Crucially, discovery of new particles in an accelerator does not prove that those new particles are dark matter. In addition, it is not easy to discover WIMPs in an accelerator. By their very nature they interact weakly, and hence they would only be evident in accelerator data by their absence - through missing energy or momentum. This makes the search for WIMPs in accelerators difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary of WIMPs\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the WIMP hypothesis is that there exists a stable particle arising from some extension to the standard model connected to the electroweak scale of $\\rm 100\\,GeV$, which was produced in large numbers in the early Universe, and which forms the dark matter in galactic halos and other large scale structures today. The mass of the WIMP is not known, but within a few orders of magnitude of $\\rm 100\\,GeV$ is usually considered a requirement. This is because if the WIMP mass is too far from this scale, it is no longer credible to think of it as part of the electroweak sector of particle physics. WIMP dark matter is still a very popular hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Axions \n",

    "#### The strong CP problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also in the 1970s, theorists and phenomenologists were working on the physics of the strong interactions. Experimental probes of the properties of nucleons led to measurements of the electric dipole moment of the neutron, because if the neutron has a non-zero electric dipole moment, given that it certainly has a magnetic dipole moment, then the neutron is not symmetric under the discrete symmetry CP. This in turn implies that the theories describing strong interactions violate the CP symmetry. Physicists were expecting that this would be so, because the electroweak forces had already been seen to violate the CP symmetry, as is shown by carefully examining the decays of the $\\rm K_L$ and $\\rm K_S$ mesons. The high-energy model of quark interactions, quantum chromodynamics, contains several physically motivated sources of CP violation. In particular, the mass terms in the theory in general violate CP, and in addition tunnelling between discrete states of the QCD vaccuum, known as instanton tunnelling, predicts further CP violiation. \n",
    "\n",
    "It was therefore a surprise when all the measurements of the neutron electric dipole moment turned out to be consistent with zero. Another back-of-the-envelope calculation can be done to show that the discrepancy between the expected sorts of neutron electric dipole moment and what is measured is something around ten orders of magnitude. This is a significant problem with the standard model of particle physics, and is known as the strong CP problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Peccei Quinn mechanism\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1978, two theorists working at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC), Robert Peccei and Helen Quinn, invented a mechanism that could be added to QCD to explain the observed conservation of the CP symmetry. This mechanism is named after them, and is called the Peccei Quinn (PQ) mechanism. We already know that the Universe undergoes phase transitions. Specifically, the electroweak (EW) phase transition breaks the previously unified electroweak force into the distinct weak and electormagnetic forces observed at todays energy scales. Similarly, we see today that quark matter is confined into neutrons, protons and other hadronic particles, which are further confined into nuclei. It wasn't always the case, and we know that a symmetry breaking mechanism operating at an energy scale of around $\\rm 100\\,MeV$, known as the QCD phase transition, resulted in the formation of nuclear matter from quark matter. In general, phase transitions change the symmetries of the theory undergoing the transition. This idea comes from solid state physics. Salty water has very different symmetry properties than the salt crystals and water vapour that result when evaporation happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "Peccei and Quinn's hypothesis is that a phase transition occurs at high energy in the early Universe that breaks a symmetry that is called the PQ symmetry. This symmetry breaking resulted in a potential in the theory that looks a bit like the higgs potential, in that you get a sombrero-hat-shaped trench. However, the same physics that gives rise to CP violation effects observed in QCD leads to this potential being tipped up, so that there is a minimum in this potential. In Peccei and Quinn's mechanism, this preferred direction corresponds to a CP conserving theory, in which the electric dipole moment of the neutron, and all other measures of CP violation, are zero. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before the formation of nucleons and nuclei in the QCD phase transition, the energies of states were so high that the existience of this minimum had no bearing on physics, However, when the energy scale of the theory dropped below the energy of the QCD phase transition, the vacuum state of QCD settles down to adopt the minimum of this potential as its vacuum state, and all the usual perturbative calculations such as Feynmann graphs are expansions about this vacuum. So, effectively, below the QCD phase transition energy, where nuclei form, the strong interactions become CP conserving. This solves the strong CP problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Axions\n",
    "\n",
    "What are axions? Any symmetry breaking process in particle physics gives rise to a new particle state known as a Goldstone boson. The Goldstone boson of electroweak symmetry breaking is the Higgs boson. Similarly, the axion is the Goldstone boson of PQ symmetry breaking. Axions are not massless any more than the Higgs. In the case of axions, it is the curvature of the tipped up 'wine bottle' potential that determines the mass of the axion. The theory is complex, but broadly speaking, if we use the symbol $f_{\\rm PQ}$ to denote the energy at which the Peccei Quinn symmetry is broken, then higher values of $$f_{\\rm PQ}$ lead to a lower axion mass, and also smaller values of the couplings of axions to other particles. But, as for WIMPs, if the scale $f_{\\rm PQ}$ is a larger energy, axions were produced at earlier times, and axion dark matter is more abundant.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Particle-like nature of WIMPs\n",
    "\n",
    "It is helpful to ask whether the dark matter WIMPs are likely to behave more like particles or waves in detectors we might build. To work this out, we estimate the De Broglie wavelength of WIMP dark matter. We assume WIMPs of mass $\\rm 100\\,GeV/c^2$ having the virial velocity in our local dark matter halo of $\\rm v_0=230\\,km\\,s^{-1}$. The De Broglie wavelength of a particle of momentum $p$ is\n",
    "$\\lambda=h/p$, where $\\lambda$ and $p$ are in SI(MKS) units. Because \n",
    "${\\rm v_0}\\ll c$, such WIMPs are non-relativistic so\n",
    "\n",
    "$$pc=mvc=mc^2(v/c).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore for these WIMPs,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$pc={\\rm (100\\,GeV)}{\\rm \\frac{230\\,km\\,s^{-1}}{300000\\,km\\,s^{-1}}}=0.{\\rm 08\\,GeV.}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The corresponding De Broglie wavelength can be calculated as follows, avoiding the error-prone chore of converting everything into SI units.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\lambda=\\frac{h}{p}=\\frac{2\\pi\\hbar c}{pc}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The constant $\\hbar c$ is $\\rm 0.2\\,GeV\\,fm$, where $\\rm fm$ means a Fermi, or $\\rm 10^{-15}m$. Hence\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\lambda=\\frac{\\rm 6.3\\times 0.2\\,GeV\\,fm}{\\rm 0.08\\,GeV}={\\rm 16\\,fm}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "An atomic nucleus of mass 131AMU (Xenon) has a radius given by $R=R_0 A^{1/3}$, where $R_0$ is about $\\rm 1.2\\,fm$, which is $\\rm 6.1\\,fm$. Hence the De Broglie wavelength of a WIMP of a mass roughly that of a Z boson having a velocity typical of that expected for dark matter in our local halo is of the same order as the size of a nuclus. Consequently, interactions of such WIMPs with such nuclei would be expected to be particle-like.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to be specific about what we mean here. If we take two spheres of classical matter, like two steel balls, and collide them, they will ram together and scatter elastically, bouncing off each other. This will happen every time we ram them together. Each elastic collision will conserve energy and momentum. When we bring a WIMP and a nucleus close together, almost every time they will fail to interact at all. Only on a very tiny fraction of occasions will they scatter elastically. When they do, however, again, energy and momentum are conserved. It is natural to explain the rarity of collisions by a classical analogy with cross sectional area. We say that the WIMP nucleon cross section is small - in most attempts at making the WIMP and the nucleus collide, the WIMP, in this classical analogy, simply 'misses' the nucleus. Of course, this idealised classical picture is only exact in a very idealised model of the collision where the WIMP and the nucleus are both hard spheres, but as we shall see this hard sphere model is surprisingly useful in analysing the collision of a WIMP with a nucleus.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have also slipped in to talking about WIMP nuclear interactions, without knowing whether such interactions are likely or observable. We have discovered that halo WIMPs and nuclei are of similar physical sizes, and that is encouraging. But, the next quesiton is, even when a WIMP and a nucleus collide, what fraction of the WIMPs energy is transferred to the nucleus? More about that next lecture.\n",

    "#### Elastic scattering of WIMPs\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we don't have a detailed model of the interactions of WIMPs, it pays to consider the simplest possible interactions that have the least possible dependence on any particular WIMP model. All fundamental particles studied so far interact at least some of the time via elastic scattering, in which the the interacting particles do not change species or generate new particles as a consequence of the interaction. Rather, they simply bounce off each other behaving rather like snooker balls colliding, though we must remember that subatomic particles are quantum entities and we will see that some quantum effects do have consequences even for simple low energy elastic scattering. \n",
    "\n",
    "We therefore hope that WIMPs also scatter inelastically, and consider how such scatters will affect the particle struck by the WIMP. Since we are doing elastic scattering, we can employ classical mechanics to analyse the elastic scattering of a WIMP off a particle from our detector, initially at rest in the lab. We start by modelling both the WIMP and the particle it scatters off as classical hard spheres. In this limit, the collision of a WIMP with a particle of the detector is fully deterministic, depending only on the masses of the WIMP and the particle it strikes, and the initial velocity of the WIMP.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### One-dimensional elastic scattering\n",
    "\n",
    "Though not realistic, treating the scattering as one-dimensional nonetheless allows us to learn a surprising amount about what we might expect from detectors. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Three-dimensional elastic scattering\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Detecting WIMP-nuclear interactions\n",
    "|\n",
    "The energy imparted to the detector when the WIMP interacts causes a variety of effects that should hopefully produce observable signatures in a well-designed detector. The detectable signature depends on the detector design, but briefly some observable signatures can result from the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ionisation of the atoms in the vicinity of the struck nucleus;\n",
    "* Promotion of nearby atoms or molecules into excited nuclear, atomic or molecular states.\n",
    "* Generation of phonons - quanta of lattice vibration in detectors designed to allow such excitations; or\n",
    "* Phase transitions in detectors designed to operate close to a phase transition, such as superheated liquids.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to stress that these observable effects are the end point of a complex series of interactions seeded by the initial single interaction of a WIMP with something in the detector. We only consider single WIMP scatters simply because the probability, or cross section, for a WIMP to interact even once is miniscule. Multiple scatter events are so unlikely that if we see one we attribute it to background - the scattering of something that isn't a WIMP, perhaps a neutron, in the detector. \n",
    "\n",
    "On this primary scatter, some energy is transferred to this struck 'primary' object, which then recoils into the surrounding detector material, distributing its energy amongst many systems. It is the collective effect of this recoil energy on a large number of atoms or molecules of the detector that is potentially observable. However, we must first work out how much energy is transfereed in the primary interaction of the WIMP, before seeing how that energy becomes detectable.\n",
