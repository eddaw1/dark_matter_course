    "# Dark matter candidates and detectors\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed in the preceding lectures by Vik Dhillon, either we modify our ideas of classial mechanics in the low acceleration limit, or we modify the size and matter contents of galaxies and clusters to include a large amount of extra, unidentified dark matter beyond the baryonic matter we already observe. In these lectures I will focus on the latter possibility, that there exists a large amount of undiscovered dark matter. I discuss the main classes of dark matter candidates and the instruments that are operating, and planned, to try and detect these dark matter candidates. \n",

    "## Dark matter might have several or many constituents\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, the existence of dark matter is so far inferred only from its gravitational interactions. Gravity couples to all objects that have mass. The total mass of a dark matter cloud is the sum of the masses of its constituents, whether those constituents are the same or different from each other. Therefore, any combination of a variety of dark matter types could act collectively as the dark matter, resulting in the gravitational effects we observe. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we already know that some MACHO dark matter is out there, but it is insufficiently abundant to explain the observed gravitational effects on its own. The remaining dark matter could be WIMPs, axions, dwarf black holes, other anticipated and/or unanticipated stable massive particle(s), or any combination of the above! The possibility, or even likelihood, of mixed dark matter, would be bad news for experimentalists. The already faint signals predicted to arise from any one of the candidates would be commensurately fainter. Nature does not, however, care how difficult things are for us in the laboratory.\n",

    "### Direct detection of WIMPs\n",
    "\n",
    "Equation is \\ref{1}.\n",
    "\n",
    "Direct detection of WIMPs involves interactions of locally present WIMPs from our own galactic dark matter halo off material in laboratory detectors. It is helpful to ask whether the dark matter WIMPs are likely to behave more like particles or waves in detectors we might build. To work this out, we estimate the De Broglie wavelength of WIMP dark matter. We assume WIMPs of mass $\\rm 100\\,GeV/c^2$ having the virial velocity in our local dark matter halo of $\\rm v_0=230\\,km\\,s^{-1}$. The De Broglie wavelength of a particle of momentum $p$ is\n",
    "$\\lambda=h/p$, where $\\lambda$ and $p$ are in SI(MKS) units. Because \n",
    "${\\rm v_0}\\ll c$, such WIMPs are non-relativistic so\n",
    "\n",
    "$$pc=mvc=mc^2(v/c).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore for these WIMPs,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$pc={\\rm (100\\,GeV)}{\\rm \\frac{230\\,km\\,s^{-1}}{300000\\,km\\,s^{-1}}}=0.{\\rm 08\\,GeV.}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The corresponding De Broglie wavelength can be calculated as follows, avoiding the error-prone chore of converting everything into SI units.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\lambda=\\frac{h}{p}=\\frac{2\\pi\\hbar c}{pc}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The constant $\\hbar c$ is $\\rm 0.2\\,GeV\\,fm$, where $\\rm fm$ means a Fermi, or $\\rm 10^{-15}m$. Hence\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\lambda=\\frac{\\rm 6.3\\times 0.2\\,GeV\\,fm}{\\rm 0.08\\,GeV}={\\rm 16\\,fm}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "An atomic nucleus of mass 131AMU (Xenon) has a radius given by $R=R_0 A^{1/3}$, where $R_0$ is about $\\rm 1.2\\,fm$, which is $\\rm 6.1\\,fm$. Hence the De Broglie wavelength of a WIMP of a mass roughly that of a Z boson having a velocity typical of that expected for dark matter in our local halo is of the same order as the size of a nuclus. Consequently, interactions of such WIMPs with such nuclei would be expected to be particle-like.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to be specific about what we mean here. If we take two spheres of classical matter, like two steel balls, and collide them, they will ram together and scatter elastically, bouncing off each other. This will happen every time we ram them together. Each elastic collision will conserve energy and momentum. When we bring a WIMP and a nucleus close together, almost every time they will fail to interact at all. Only on a very tiny fraction of occasions will they scatter elastically. When they do, however, again, energy and momentum are conserved. It is natural to explain the rarity of collisions by a classical analogy with cross sectional area. We say that the WIMP nucleon cross section is small - in most attempts at making the WIMP and the nucleus collide, the WIMP, in this classical analogy, simply 'misses' the nucleus. Of course, this idealised classical picture is only exact in a very idealised model of the collision where the WIMP and the nucleus are both hard spheres, but as we shall see this hard sphere model is surprisingly useful in analysing the collision of a WIMP with a nucleus.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have also slipped in to talking about WIMP nuclear interactions, without knowing whether such interactions are likely or observable. We have discovered that halo WIMPs and nuclei are of similar physical sizes, and that is encouraging. But, the next quesiton is, even when a WIMP and a nucleus collide, what fraction of the WIMPs energy is transferred to the nucleus?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Elastic scattering of WIMPs\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we don't have a detailed model of the interactions of WIMPs, it pays to consider the simplest possible interactions that have the least possible dependence on any particular WIMP model. All fundamental particles studied so far interact at least some of the time via elastic scattering, in which the the interacting particles do not change species or generate new particles as a consequence of the interaction. Rather, they simply bounce off each other behaving rather like snooker balls colliding, though we must remember that subatomic particles are quantum entities and we will see that some quantum effects do have consequences even for simple low energy elastic scattering. \n",
    "\n",
    "We therefore hope that WIMPs also scatter inelastically, and consider how such scatters will affect the particle struck by the WIMP. Since we are doing elastic scattering, we can employ classical mechanics to analyse the elastic scattering of a WIMP off a particle from our detector, initially at rest in the lab. We start by modelling both the WIMP and the particle it scatters off as classical hard spheres. In this limit, the collision of a WIMP with a particle of the detector is fully deterministic, depending only on the masses of the WIMP and the particle it strikes, and the initial velocity of the WIMP.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### One-dimensional elastic scattering\n",
    "\n",
    "Though not realistic, treating the scattering as one-dimensional nonetheless allows us to learn a surprising amount about what we might expect from detectors. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Three-dimensional elastic scattering\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Detecting WIMP-nuclear interactions\n",
    "|\n",
    "The energy imparted to the detector when the WIMP interacts causes a variety of effects that should hopefully produce observable signatures in a well-designed detector. The detectable signature depends on the detector design, but briefly some observable signatures can result from the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ionisation of the atoms in the vicinity of the struck nucleus;\n",
    "* Promotion of nearby atoms or molecules into excited nuclear, atomic or molecular states.\n",
    "* Generation of phonons - quanta of lattice vibration in detectors designed to allow such excitations; or\n",
    "* Phase transitions in detectors designed to operate close to a phase transition, such as superheated liquids.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to stress that these observable effects are the end point of a complex series of interactions seeded by the initial single interaction of a WIMP with something in the detector. We only consider single WIMP scatters simply because the probability, or cross section, for a WIMP to interact even once is miniscule. Multiple scatter events are so unlikely that if we see one we attribute it to background - the scattering of something that isn't a WIMP, perhaps a neutron, in the detector. \n",
    "\n",
    "On this primary scatter, some energy is transferred to this struck 'primary' object, which then recoils into the surrounding detector material, distributing its energy amongst many systems. It is the collective effect of this recoil energy on a large number of atoms or molecules of the detector that is potentially observable. However, we must first work out how much energy is transfereed in the primary interaction of the WIMP, before seeing how that energy becomes detectable.\n",
