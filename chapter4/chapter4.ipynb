Overall the quantity in brackets is a number of atoms in the detector, so it is dimensionless.\n",

    "The remaining quantities, $\\sigma_{\\rm NUC}$, $n$ and $v_w$ have units $\\rm L^2$, $L^{-3}$ and $L\\,T^{-1}$, where as usual $\\rm L$ is length, $\\rm T$ is time and $\\rm M$ is mass. Their product therefore has dimensions $T^{-1}$, and this is the overall dimensions of the rate. This is correct, because the formula represents the number of decays per unit time. If all these three quantities are given in SI units, $R_{\\rm TOT}(v_w)$ will be per second, units $\\rm s^{-1}$.\n",

    "The cross section here is the effective area of a single nucleus for elastic scattering. It's SI units are square meters.

So, if we want experimentalists to use this result, we need to allow them to enter the cross section in their familiar unit of picobarns.

Now, astrophysicists talk about the dark matter as having a halo density in $\\rm GeV/cc$. What this means is, the rest energy in a cubic centimetre of dark matter. So, suppose the WIMPs have a rest mass $\\rm m_w$. If there are $n$ WIMPs per cubic metre, then there are $10^{-6}n$ WIMPs per cubic centimetre. The rest energy per cubic centimetre is then $10^{-6}nm_wc^2$. This is usually given the symbol $\\rho_{\\rm H}$. So, if $\\rho_{\\rm H}=10^{-6}nm_wc^2$ then $n=10^6\\rho_H/(m_wc^2)$.

    "## Converting to the nucleon cross section\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have been regarding the scattering entity as the entire nucleus, and writing the cross section for the entire nucleus scattering as $\\sigma_{\\rm NUC}$. However, in dark matter physics, the quantity that is usually used to represent the cross section is the elastic cross section for the scattering of WIMPs off individual nucleons, protons or neutrons. This quantity $\\sigma_N$ is nominally the same for neutrons and protons, since they are effectively equivalent when it comes to the weak interactions underlying the scattering process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The naive answer is that each nucleus contains A nucleons, therefore $\\sigma_{\\rm NUC}^{\\rm Naive}=A\\sigma_N$. However, this supposes that the nucleons in the nucleus are all independent of each other. In fact, this is not true, in two senses. First, they act coherently with regards to the interaction itself. Second, when the interaction has taken place, the entire nucleus recoils, not just a single nucleon. \n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of coherence of the interaction, if we assume the amplitude for scattering off one nucleon is $\\psi$, then if the nucleons were independent, the probability of scattering off the whole nucleus would be the sum of the probabities for each nucleon, $P=|\\psi|^2+|\\psi|^s+\\cdots{\\rm (A\\,terms)}\\cdots+|\\psi|^2=A|\\psi|^2$. However, if the scattering processes off each of the nucleons are all coherent, then $P=|\\psi+\\psi+\\cdots{\\rm (A\\,terms)}\\cdots+\\psi|^2=A^2|\\psi|^2$. So, the coherent scattering case has a factor of $A$ larger cross section than the incoherent scattering case. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the whole nucleus recoiling, we are considering a recoil at a given recoil energy $E_R$. If this is considered constant, but we compare a nucleon recoiling to a nucleus recoiling, how do the underlying quantities change? The mass of the recoiling object increases by a factor of $A$. If $E_R=p^2/2m$, then for $E_R$ to remain the same, $p^2$ must also increase by a factor of $A$, hence $p$ increases by a factor of $\\sqrt{A}$. If we focus on recoil energies in a range $E_R$ to $E_R+dE_R$, the number of ways the nucleus can recoil with this energy is called the density of final states, $dN/dE_R$. This quantity can be written $dN/dp$ times $dp/dE_R$. The quantity $dN/dp$ is given by the circumference of a circle of radius $p$, since the radius scales with the momentum. The quantity $dp/dE_R$ is $1/(dE_R/dp)$. When \n",
    "$E_R=p^2/(2m)$, we have $dE_R/dp=p/m$, so $dp/dE_R =m/p$. Therefore $dN/dE_R$ scales as $p\\times(m/p)$, which is $m$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, if the entire nucleus recoils, the mass of the recoiling entitiy scales up from $m$ to $Am$, and hence the number of final states in an energy range $E_R$ to $E_R+dE_R$ is a factor of $A$ greater in the case of the whole nucleus recoiling, compared to the case of a single nucleon recoiling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summarising, at fixed recoil energy $E_R$, in addition to the naive factor of $A$ from there being $A$ nucleons in the nuclus, the cross section for elastic scattering off a nucleus is greater enhanced with respect to elastic scattering off its individual nucleons by two further factors of $A$, one arising from coherence between scattering processes off nucleons in the nucleus, and the other arising from the number of available final states for the whole nucleus recoiling compared to the case of a single nucleus recoiling. \n",
