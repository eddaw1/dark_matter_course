    "# Lecture 3 - Quantum analysis of WIMP nucleus scattering\n",
    "\n",
    "The hard sphere scattering model yields lots of information, but it isn't perfect. We have assumed that the nucleus and WIMP are hard balls, but we know that on a microscopic level, scattering objects have wave as well as particle properties that will affect the interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "What other inputs can we draw on to find out what happens when a WIMP scatters off a nucleus? Let us take an opposite extreme with the modelling and think of the WIMP's wave properties. How do plane waves scatter off an object?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classical plane wave scattering\n",
    "\n",
    "You will recall some optics problems when a plane wave scatters off a slit in a screen. What you see on a screen on the other side is a series of interference fringes - in some places you get zero intensity, and in other places you get an intensity maximum. Interestingly you can show that the interference pattern you get for diffraction off a solid body having the same dimensions as those of the slit in the screen is the same pattern. Anyway, this is nothing like particle behaviour. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let us next consider a classical wave problem that has the same look and feel and perhaps a shade more intuition than optical waves diffracting off a slit-shaped solid - plane water waves scattering off a post, as illustrated in the diagram below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![off_post](./figures/off_post.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The incoming wavefronts are vertical planes which you can think of as the crests of the wave moving to the right. There is a post in the water. When the plane waves strike the post, the result can be thought of as a fraction of the plane waves carrying on propagating to the right, but a portion of the plane waves scatter off the post with the result that a circular wave travels outwards from the post. The outgoing circular wave interferes with the plane waves resulting in an interference pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, what about scattering in quantum mechanics? Many things are different. For classical waves:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Classical waves represent the amplitude of an observable wave.\n",
    "* The differential equation governing the wave is the wave equation.\n",
    "* The motion of the water is observable and predictable.\n",
    "\n",
    "For quantum scattering:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Quantum waves represent the amplitude of the wave function.\n",
    "* The differential equation governing the wave function is the Schrodinger equation.\n",
    "* The modulus squared of the wave function gives the probability that the WIMP will be observed at that point.\n",
    "* The wave function representing the final state is predictable.\n",
    "* However, this does not mean that the WIMP's final trajectory is predictable, because the wave function\n",
    "only gives a probability distribution for where the WIMP goes after scattering.\n",
    "\n",
    "What about the process of calculating the wave function?\n",
    "\n",
    "* The wave function cannot be precisely calculated as Schrodinger's equation cannot be solved exactly.\n",
    "* However, we can solve approximately for the final state of the WIMP using perturbation theory."

    "This integral can therefore be interpreted as enforcing energy conservation. In a real scattering event, as we have seen from the hard sphere model, the WIMP recoils, and hence energy conservation leads to the sum of the nuclear recoil energy and the wimp recoil energy equaling the incident WIMP energy. In this quantum mechanical analysis, we are approximating the nucleus as a stationary scattering potential, because we have explicitly written $V(\\vec{r})$, so the potential doesn't have any time dependence. It is not surprising that this leads to a requirement that the initial and final energies of the WIMP are the same. It's an approximate treatment, but as you will see it does allow us to learn some other interesting things about the interaction - interesting but not particularly fortunate if you are an experimentalist."

    "The upper plot shows $F^2(E_R)$ as a function of the nuclear recoil energy, $E_R$. This drops off rapidly with increasing $E_R$, so that the more momentum is transferred to the nucleus, the more the form factor suppresses the probability of the scattering. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a big departure from the picture in the hard sphere scattering model, where the probability distribution for the recoil energy was flat up to the maximum value allowed by conservation of energy and momentum. The relative probablity density of recoil energy $E_R$ in the hard sphere scattering model is shown in the lower plot, again as a function of $E_R$. The area under the orange curve is 1, as the integral of the probability density over all physically permitted values of E_R is 1; the recoil energy of the nucleus has to be something!\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the function $\\sin^2(qR)/(qR)^2={\\rm sinc}^2(qR)$ has minima at \n",
    "$qR=n\\pi$. So, just as in a diffraction pattern of a plane wave off a slit, there will be zeros in the interference pattern, corresponding to recoil energies which the nucleus cannot acquire according to this model.\n",
    "\n",
    "More sophisticated form factor calculations also exhibit these zeros. We can plot the form factor in our crude model, and show some form factor calculations from publications that exhibit similar features. \n",
    "\n",
    "All of this leads us to the idea that to be sensitive to WIMPs via the detection of nuclear recoils, we had better make\n",
    "our detectors as sensitive as we can to nuclei recoiling with low kinetic energies. The form factor effect means that the rate of nuclear recoils at the maximum energy permitted by kinematics (energy and momentum conservation) is in fact about 30 times lower than the rate of very low energy recoils, due to interference between WIMP scattering amplitudes off different points on the surface of the nucleus."
