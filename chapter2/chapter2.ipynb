    "# Lecture 2 - Elastic scattering of WIMPs\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we don't know exactly what a WIMP is, we have to make some assumptions about properties we would expect all WIMPs to have in order to detect them. The most robust direct searches for WIMPs, which it turns out also have the greatest sensitivities, make the assumption that all WIMPs, no matter what their theoretical origin, will scatter elastically off a nucleus. By elastic scattering, we mean that before and after the scatter, the species involved are the same. So, in goes a WIMP and strikes a nucleus, and after the collision you are left with the same WIMP and the same species of nucleus. Have a think about why this corresponds to the meaning of elastic scattering in ordinary classical physics. The nucleus, however, has gained some energy, and it turns out that this energy could be sufficient, with the right choice of detector material, to give rise to signals that could potentially be detected in a variety of different ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "An additional important assumption made by all direct searches is that WIMPs are all around us in the laboratory. This is true if the dark matter halo of our galaxy exists, consists of WIMPs, and is sufficiently smooth so that there is a non-zero density everywhere within the halo. Recall from Vik's lectures on the local dark matter halo that the energy density of dark matter in the vicinity of Earth is thought to be something like $\\rm \\rho_H=0.3\\,GeV\\,cm^{-3}$. This is the total energy density of the WIMP dark matter, dominated by the energy associated the rest masses of the WIMPs.\n",

    "## Overall WIMP elastic scattering rate for an idealised detector\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us consider an idealised detector consisting of a cuboid of nuclei of some element, atomic number $A$. The cuboid is of height $H$, width $W$ and length $L$, and contains a mass $M$ in kilograms of the detecting element. The number of nuclei available for WIMPs to scatter off, $N$, is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{align}\n",
    "N&=\\frac{1000MN_A}{A},\n",
    "\\tag{2.1}\n",
    "\\end{align}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $N_A$ is Avogadro's number and the factor of $\\rm 1000$ occurs because $A$ is the number of grams in a mole of a substance. Now, let us consider WIMPs having some velocity $v$ incident normal to the end of this detector, height $H$ and width $W$. From the perspective of the incoming WIMP, there are $N$ target particles. The probability of elastic scattering off any one of the nuclei is encoded in the elastic scattering cross section for the nucleus. This is the classical area that the incoming WIMP has to strike in order for any elastic scatter to occur. This area is the same for each nucleus, as they are all physically identical. These cross sections are such tiny areas that the probability of the WIMP scattering twice is negligible. Let us use $\\sigma_{\\rm NUC}$ to denote this elastic scattering cross section off a nuclus. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since each nucleus is independent of the others, the total cross section for elastic scattering off any one of the nuclei is the number of nuclei times $\\sigma_{\\rm NUC}$. So, the total cross section for scattering in the detector, $\\sigma_{\\rm DET}$, is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\sigma_{\\rm DET}&=N\\sigma_{\\rm NUC}=\\frac{1000MN_A\\sigma_{\\rm NUC}}{A}.\n",
    "\\tag{2.2}\n",
    "\\end{align}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the nuclei are distributed roughly uniformly throughout the volume, the probability of our WIMP intersecting one of the cross sections required for scattering is given by the ratio of this cross section to the total area of the detector to the incoming WIMP, which is $WH$. Therefore the probability $p_{\\rm 1e}$ of a single WIMP undergoing an elastic scatter in the detector is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{align}\n",
    "p_{\\rm 1e}&=\\frac{\\sigma_{\\rm DET}}{WH}=\\frac{1000MN_A\\sigma_{\\rm NUC}}{AWH}.\n",
    "\\tag{2.3}\n",
    "\\end{align}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now consider a population of WIMPs all having this same velocity $v$. Suppose that the number density of these WIMPs is $n$ per cubic metre. If they are all approaching the detector in the same direction, then the flux, the number of WIMPs crossing a unit area of detector surface into the detector per unit time, is given by $\\Phi=nv$. This is because the common velocity of the WIMPs is $v$ metres per second, so $v$ metres cubed passes into the detector in a second for each $\\rm m^2$ of the detector surface. However, the area of the end of the detector is $WH$ so that the number of WIMPs entering the detector per second is $\\Phi WH=nvWH$. Each of these WIMPs has a probability of $p_{\\rm 1e}$ of scattering. Hence the rate at which elastic scatters occurs between this population of WIMPs and the nuclei in the detector, $R_{\\rm TOT}(v)$, is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{align}\n",
    "R_{\\rm TOT}(v)&=\\frac{1000MN_A\\sigma_{\\rm NUC}nv}{A}.\n",
    "\\tag{2.4}\n",
    "\\end{align}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that this scattering rate depends on the total mass $M$ of the detector, but not the ratio of its side lengths. Any cuboid will have the same scattering rate. In fact, it turns out that only the amount of detector material, the number of nuclei, is present in the rate formula. You can make a WIMP detector any shape you like, and optimise its shape to suit the detectors that are instrumenting it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## WIMP nucleon elastic cross sections\n",
    "\n",
    "The underlying process is the interaction of a WIMP with a neutron or a proton. We have reasonable confidence that WIMPs will scatter off neutrons and protons because they are by definition weakly interacting, and the weak gauge bosons, $\\rm W^{\\pm}$ and $\\rm Z^0$ have couplings to nucleons. Of course, the nucleons are in turn composed of quarks and gluons, but at the low energies of WIMP elastic scattering it is protons and neutrons, or nucleons, that act as the fundamental particles inside the nucleus. It is at higher energies accessible only in accelerators where you start to see scattering off individual quarks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the fundamental process is between a WIMP and a nucleon, its probability is usually expressed in terms of the WIMP nucleon cross section, which we denote by $\\sigma_N$. This cross section is the same for neutrons and protons because WIMPs are electrically neutral and hence do not couple to the different charges of protons and neutrons. The question is, how is this cross section related to the cross section for the process that actually occurs, which is the elastic scattering of the WIMP off the whole nucleus, $\\sigma_{\\rm NUC}$?\n",
    "\n",
    "Naively, a nucleus consists of $A$ nucleons, so you might expect that $\\sigma_{\\rm NUC}$ is perhaps equal to $A\\sigma_N$. This assumption is based on treating the nucleons in the nucleus as if they act independently of each other. For the nucleons in a nucleus t act independently in this way, two things would have to be true:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The WIMP would have to couple to one nucleon in the nucleus, without having any interaction or coupling to the other nucleons.\n",
    "* This single nucleon would then have to scatter out of the nucleus, taking the recoil energy and momentum from the collision and leaving the other nucleons behind.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neither of these requirements are satisfied. In fact, both in the interaction and in the final state recoil, the nucleons in the nucleus behave coherently. It turns out that this coherence between nucleons enhances the cross section for scattering of a nucleus by WIMPs substantially compared to the naive $\\sigma_{\\rm NUC}=A\\sigma_N$ that results from assuming incoherent scattering. \n",
    "\n",
    "## WIMP nucleon elastic scattering modelled as a collision between hard spheres\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that even though the elastic collision of a WIMP with a nucleus is a quantum mechanical process, we can learn much by modelling this process as an ordinary classical elastic collision of two hard spheres. The diagram below represents such a collision.\n",
    "\n",
    "![elastic scattering](./figures/wimp_recoil_lab/wimp_recoil_lab.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "We aim here to learn about the kinematics of the WIMP nuclear elastic collision. Because we are using a classical model, some classical parameters and concepts enter into this model of the problem. These classical ideas should be absent from the final results. One example is the classical radii of the incoming WIMP and that of the target nucleus. In this model, the sum of the classical radii of the WIMP and the nucleus is $R$. The incoming trajectory of the WIMP, extrapolated past the collision point, has a closest approach to the centre of the target WIMP of distance $b$. This distance of closest approach, $b$, is called the impact parameter of the collision. If $b>R$, then the WIMP misses the nucleus and no elastic scatter takes place. The correspondance with cross sections is that the collision cross section for the WIMP nuclear scatter is $\\sigma_{\\rm NUC}=\\pi R^2$. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Perturbative quantum mechanical analysis of WIMP nuclear elastic scattering\n",
    "\n",
    "The hard sphere scattering model yields lots of information, but it isn't perfect. We have assumed that the nucleus is a hard ball, but we know that we are actually interested in scattering off the neutrons and protons it contains. We could do with a slightly more sophisticated quantum mechanical treatment of the scattering problem. Fortunately, the scattering problem is non-relativistic, so that with a little extra work the non-relativistic perturbation theory you learned in second year can be used to analyse WIMP nuclear scattering.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we put the entire system, the WIMP, the nucleus, everything, in a box. This has the effect of making the space of states for the incoming and outgoing WIMP finite. We start by writing down Schrodingers equation for the free WIMP, without the interaction with the nucleus. The eigenstates of the time independent Schrodinger equation available to the WIMP are $\\phi_n(\\vec{x})$ corresponding to energy eigenvalues $E_n$ so that the time independent Schrodinger equation is $H_0\\phi_n(\\vec{x})=E_n\\phi_n(x)$. The different possible states in the box obey an orthonormality relation, so that\n",

    "\\tag{2.5}\n",
    "\\end{align}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, following the usual method for perturbation theory, we modify the Hamiltonian to include the scattering nucleus. The new Hamiltonian is $H=H_0+V(\\vec{x})$. We have assumed that the nucleus is static during the interaction, so that its potential $V(\\vec{x})$ is time independent. Of course, the nucleus recoils after the collision and moves, but we can approximate that there is no further interaction between the WIMP and the nucleus after the collision, and therefore this motion can be neglected for analysing the interaction.\n",

    "After the collision the state of the WIMP has changed to $\\psi(x)$, but in perturbation theory this state is expressed as a superposition of the states of the unperturbed Hamiltonian.\n",

    "The physical meaning of this result, known as the Fermi golden rule, is as follows. $R_{fi}$ is the rate of conversion of incoming WIMPs into this particular final state, which we take to be the WIMP and nucleus having undergone elastic scattering. The Dirac delta means that the process only has a non-zero rate if total energy, and hence kinetic energy, is conserved. If total energy is conserved, then the rate for this particular process is given by the modulus squared of the matrix element, $V_{fi}$. This matrix element contains the quantum physics of the interaction between the WIMP and the nucleus. Its detailed form is dependent on the exact physics behind the WIMP in question, but $V_{fi}$ may be diagrammatically represented as below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluation of these matrix elements turns out to have quite an important impact on the rate of WIMP nuclear elastic scattering, and is the first part of the connection between the WIMP nuclear and WIMP nucleon elastic scattering cross sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final important observation is that there may be more than one final state that has the same final state kinetic energy of the WIMP. We already know from the hard sphere scattering analysis that the final state kinetic energy of the WIMP is determined by the scattering angle $\\theta$. However, the azimuthal angle $\\phi$ can be anything, and still give rise to the same final state WIMP kinetic energy. If we are interested in the rate of a particular final state nuclear recoil energy, the rate is multiplied by the number of states in which the nuclear recoil energy takes a particular value. Classically, there are an infinite number of values of the azimuthal angle, but quantum mechanically the final state is quantised, and the number of possible states is, as alluded to in the hard sphere analysis, proportional to the magnitude of the final state momentum of the nucleus. This is closely analogous to the calculation of the density of the final states in statistical mechanics, only here one of the two angles is fixed, and only the other one is allowed to vary. So, the golden rule as sometimes written contains a factor usually denoted by $\\rho(E_f)$, or $dN/dE_f$, customarily called the density of final states. This is in fact the degeneracy of final states that have the same final state observables. The density of final states turns out to be critical to the second part of working out the connection between the WIMP nuclear and WIMP nucleon elastic scattering cross sections. "
