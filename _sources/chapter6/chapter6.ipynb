    "# Axion detectors\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed in my first lecture, axions having masses of order $\\rm 10\\,\\mu eV$ and velocities of order $\\rm 200\\,km\\,s^{-1}$ have De Broglie wavelengths of order $\\rm 100\\,m$. The number density of axions in the halo is the rest energy density of approximately $\\rm 0.5\\,GeV/cc$ divided by the axion mass, or around $\\rm 5\\times10^{13}/cc$. Therefore the axion quanta have enormous overlap with one another, and we may treat the axions as wave-like. \n",
    "\n",
    "Pierre Sikivie was the first to propose the axion haloscope. The idea is to exploit the form of the coupling between axions and electromagnetic waves and look for the conversion of an axion into a single real microwave/UHF photon in the presence of a large magnetic field. The figure below shows a schematic of a Sikivie-type resonant cavity haloscope, connected to the first stage of the electronics used to probe the detector for axion signals.\n",

    "\n",
    "The idea is that the axion field, present all around the detector in the halo of our galaxy, couples to the magnetic field threading the cavity. This coupling destroys the axion and creates a real photon. The second photon in the axion-photon coupling is supplied by the magnetic field.\n",

    "The magnetic field can be modelled quantum-mechanically as a source of photons having zero frequency, but still carrying momentum. Classically this would be disallowed, since a zero energy photon also has zero momentum, but in quantum mechanics virtual particles do not have to have the conventional energy-momentum-mass relation. Such phenomena are sometimes referred to as off-mass-shell.\n",
    "\n",
    "The energy from the incoming axion is dominated by its rest energy, $\\rm m_ac^2$. The incoming axion is annihilated and a real on-mass-shell photon results, having a frequency $\\nu$. The axion also has kinetic energy arising from its velocity, which is of order the virial velocity, $\\rm 230\\,km\\,s^{-1}$. Energy conservation implies that\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{align*}\n",
    "h\\nu &= m_a c^2 + \\frac{1}{2}m_a c^2 \\left(\\frac{v}{c}\\right)^2.\n",
    "\\end{align*}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Inserting some numbers, $v^2/(2c^2)$ is $\\rm 3\\times 10^{-7}$, Therefore, if there are multiple axions converting into photons, the result will be excess power in the magnetic field forming a narrow line having frequency given by $h\\nu=m_ac^2$, and a line width of $3\\times10^{-7}$ of the frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider, for example, with a $\\rm 10\\,\\mu eV/c^2$ axion. The rest energy of this axion is converted into a frequency in $\\rm Hz$ by multiplying by $\\rm e=1.6\\times10^{-19}\\,J/eV$ and dividing by Planck's constant, \n",
    "$\\rm h=6.63\\times 10^{-34}\\,Js$. In this case the result is $\\rm 2.4\\,GHz$. This electromagnetic wave is in the microwave frequency range. The width of the emission line is about $3\\times10^{-7}$ of that, or $\\rm 720\\,Hz$."
