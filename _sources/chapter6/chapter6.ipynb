    "# Axion detectors\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed in my first lecture, axions having masses of order $\\rm 10\\,\\mu eV$ and velocities of order $\\rm 200\\,km\\,s^{-1}$ have De Broglie wavelengths of order $\\rm 100\\,m$. The number density of axions in the halo is the rest energy density of approximately $\\rm 0.5\\,GeV/cc$ divided by the axion mass, or around $\\rm 5\\times10^{13}/cc$. Therefore the axion quanta have enormous overlap with one another, and we may treat the axions as wave-like. \n",
    "\n",
    "Pierre Sikivie was the first to propose the axion haloscope. The idea is to exploit the form of the coupling between axions and electromagnetic waves and look for the conversion of an axion into a single real microwave/UHF photon in the presence of a large magnetic field. The figure below shows a schematic of a Sikivie-type resonant cavity haloscope, connected to the first stage of the electronics used to probe the detector for axion signals.\n",

    "The idea is that the axion field, present all around the detector in the halo of our galaxy, couples to the magnetic field threading the cavity. This coupling destroys the axion and creates a real photon. The second photon in the axion-photon coupling is supplied by the magnetic field.\n",

    "The magnetic field can be modelled quantum-mechanically as a source of photons having zero frequency, but still carrying momentum. Classically this would be disallowed, since a zero energy photon also has zero momentum, but in quantum mechanics virtual particles do not have to have the conventional energy-momentum-mass relation. Such phenomena are sometimes referred to as off-mass-shell.\n",
    "\n",
    "The energy from the incoming axion is dominated by its rest energy, $\\rm m_ac^2$. The incoming axion is annihilated and a real on-mass-shell photon results, having a frequency $\\nu$. The axion also has kinetic energy arising from its velocity, which is of order the virial velocity, $\\rm 230\\,km\\,s^{-1}$. Energy conservation implies that\n",

    "## Resonant detection\n",
    "\n",
    "In Sikivie's axion haloscope, the region in which the axions convert to photons, defined by the magnetic field, is surrounded by a metal resonant cavity. Such cavities possess electromagnetic resonances. The geometry of the cavity is that it is a circular cylinder, containing a secondary metal cylinder used to tune the resonances. Focusing on the cavity for now, we note that the metal walls define boundary conditions on the electromagnetic fields inside the cavity. The each component of the electric and magnetic fields can be shown to obey a wave equation, the solutions of which are waves constrained by the boundary conditions at the walls of the cavity. These boundary conditions lead to particular frequencies of electromagnetic radiation being resonant in the cavity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Resonances are ubiquitous in physics. The principle of resonant enhancement can be understood by thinking about a pendulum suspended from your fingers. If you move your hand back and forth at the resonant frequency, the pendulum swings back and forth with an amplitude bigger than the motion of your hand by a numerical factor called the quality factor, $Q$, of the pendulum oscillator. The factor $Q$ depends on the quality of construction of the pendulum.\n",
    "\n",
    "By analogy, the cavity enhances the signal from axion to photon conversion by a factor $Q$, the quality factor of an electromagnetic resonance of the cavity, when the cavity is tuned so that this resonance has a frequency related to the axion mass by $\\rm h\\nu=m_ac^2$. For the example considered above, we'd need a cavity that can support a $\\rm 2.4\\,GHz$ resonance. \n",
    "\n",
    "In reality, we don't know the axion mass, so we must use a tunable resonator. The simplist way to achieve this is to insert another metal object, a tuning rod, into the cavity, and allow for it to be moved around, varying the distance of the cavity axis from the symmetry axis of the cavity. The necessity of a movable tuning rod is in fact one of the most difficult aspects of operating an axion haloscope. It is both hard to move at the low temperatures that turn out to be necessary, and furthermore tends to reduce the quality factor $Q$ of the electromagnetic resonance, and thereby the sensitivity of the detector. \n",

    "This section shows you how to go from Equation 6.7, which is in watts, but doesn't give you any physically meaningful scale for the axion field strength $a^2$. In this section I bring in some results from axion theory and phenomenology to show you the path to a result where $a^2$ is expressed in terms of the axion mass and coupling to photons. This is more useful for laboratory experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed at the start of this lecture, the quantity $g_{a\\gamma\\gamma}^2a^2$ is dimensionless. $g_{a\\gamma\\gamma}$ is the amplitude for axion to photon coupling, which is usually given using energy units, such that $[g_{a\\gamma\\gamma}]={\\rm GeV^{-1}}$. Therefore the units of $a^2$ had better be $\\rm GeV^2$ overall. However, we know that the power for axion to photon conversion is going to be proportional to $\\rho_H$, the halo density of dark matter, presuming that it is axions.
